# SYMPLECTIC-SIMULATIONS
This repository contains the codes and results from my Bachelor's Thesis on variational integrators.

In the main folder you may find the Hamiltonian formulation for simulating: the oscillator,the simple pendulum, the 2-body problem (2-dimensional), the 3-body problem, and the general n-body problem (2 and 3 dimensional)

In the "functions" folder, codes are given for numerical methods: Euler, Symplectic Euler (1,2), St√∂rmer--Verlet (12,21), Heun, Ralston, Midpoint, RK-3, RK-4, RK-5 (all explicit, symplectic methods MUST be used for separable problems).
There are also two functions for drawing the full trajectories of the n-body problems (for both the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional case) and the corresponding videos that represent the full trajectories.

All images and videos produced by the codes are to be saved in the folder "results", the user will find some examples of the simulations already there.
